why default is used and why it is used while exporting class/function in react?

The default keyword in JavaScript is used when exporting a class, function, or variable to indicate that it is the default export of a module. 
In React, this is commonly used to export components, utility functions, or classes.

The default export allows you to export a single value or entity from a module and import it without using curly braces {}. 
This is useful when a module is designed to export one primary thing.
