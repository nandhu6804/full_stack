1.To set up multiple components with routing in our application, you can use a routing library like React Router for React applications or Express Router for Node.js/Express backend routing.

2.Inline CSS applies styles directly within an element's style attribute. Internal CSS uses a <style> block in the HTML <head> to define styles for the document. External CSS links a separate stylesheet file, allowing reusable and centralized styling, with all methods producing the same output if styles match.
